= Division [[div]]

These modules perform division operations on binary integer inputs.

When the true quotient is not integral, these division modules always round toward zero. This matches the behavior of integer division in most modern programming languages.

[WARNING]
Dividing by zero produces undefined results. Modules may output any result under this scenario. Users of these modules should guard against this case explicitly.

<<<

== Combinational Division [[div_comb]]

These modules perform division operations on binary integer inputs using pure combinational logic.

[CAUTION]
These modules are typically very large. Do not use them unless absolutely necessary. Use the sequential variants if possible.

== Sequential Division [[div_seq]]

These modules perform multiplication operations on binary integer inputs using multi-step sequential logic. They are small, but they take longer to produce a result compared to their combinational counterparts.

Contrary to multiplication, the division modules only retire 1 bit of the quotient every cycle.

Assert the `START` signal in the same cycle as `A` and `B` to begin a multiplication between `A` and `B`. Result is shown after `CYCLE` cycles, and is accompanied by a high `DONE` signal in the same clock period.

....
{ signal: [
  {name: 'CLK'  , wave: 'xd0P|P.x'},
  ['IN',
    {name: 'A'    , wave: 'x.3x|...', data: ['a']},
    {name: 'B'    , wave: 'x.3x|...', data: ['b']},
    {name: 'START', wave: '0.10|...', node: '..m'},
  ],
  { node: '...I..J' },
  ['OUT',
    {name: 'DONE' , wave: '1..0|.1.', node: '...n'},
    {name: 'Q'    , wave: '4..x|.5.', data: ['old value', 'a / b']},
    {name: 'R'    , wave: '4..x|.5.', data: ['old value', 'a%b']},
  ]
], edge: [
  'm-|->n',
  'I+J CYCLE'
]}
....

[NOTE]
If a `START` signal is asserted for a rising clock edge before `DONE` is asserted, the old request is always discarded. The module behaves as if the current request is the only request.

= Comparison [[comp]]

These modules perform comparison operations on binary integer inputs.

== COMP COMB [[comp_comb]]

Combinational Comparison

The comparison module supports comparing signed and unsigned numbers and outputs equal and greater signals. Other signals, like less-than-or-equal, can be made by negating and combining existing signals. Each signal is color-coded for easy identification.

.Output Signals:
[%unbreakable]
* *EQ*~green~: Equal
* *SG*~cyan~: Signed Greater - `Signed A > Signed B`
* *UG*~blue~: Unsigned Greater - `Unsigned A > Unsigned B`
* *MG*~purple~: Mixed Greater Type-1 - `Signed A > Unsigned B`
* *XG*~red~: Mixed Greater Type-2 - `Unsigned B > Signed A`
